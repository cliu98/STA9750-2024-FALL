<section id="introduction" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>The public transit systems found nationwide in the United States play an important role in mobilizing people in their daily lives. This analysis will give an overview of how the transit systems perform relative to another by examining key metrics such as farebox revenues, total number of trips, total vehicle miles traveled and total revenues and expenses by source.</p>
<p>This analysis will examine information from 2022 that utilizes data from fare revenue, monthly ridership, and operating expense reports. By evaluating the metrics mentioned earlier, this analysis will identify trends, expose common challenges, and offer insight into transit performances. Various transit performance metrics will be analyzed to gain a general overview of the data. Based on these findings, transit system efficiency will be evaluated on a comparative basis. The working data sets are provided by the <em>Federal Transit Administration</em>. The latter half of the analysis will examine metrics that can define a transit system as efficient. The evaluation of efficiency will depend on the interpretation of what makes something <em>efficient</em>.</p>

<section id="preparing-cleaning-loading-the-dataset" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="preparing-cleaning-loading-the-dataset">Preparing, Cleaning &amp; Loading the Dataset</h4>
<p>The relevant data sets used in the analysis can be found here:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="http://www.transit.dot.gov/sites/fta.dot.gov/files/2024-04/2022%20Fare%20Revenue.xlsx">2022 fare revenue</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://data.transportation.gov/api/views/dkxx-zjd6/rows.csv?date=20231102&amp;accessType=DOWNLOAD&amp;bom=true&amp;format=true">2022 expenses</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://www.transit.dot.gov/sites/fta.dot.gov/files/2024-09/July%202024%20Complete%20Monthly%20Ridership%20%28with%20adjustments%20and%20estimates%29_240903.xlsx">ridership</a></p></li>
</ul>
<p>The first step in the analysis is to ingest the relevant data tables and prepare them for data analysis using R. The following code will clean and join the tables into relevant dataframes used in the analysis. The output will create the following dataframes named: <strong><em><code>FARES</code></em></strong>, <strong><em><code>EXPENSES</code></em></strong>, <strong><em><code>FINANCIALS</code></em></strong>, <strong><em><code>TRIPS</code></em></strong>, <strong><em><code>MILES</code></em></strong>, and <strong><em><code>USAGE</code></em></strong>.</p>

<p>The analysis will be initially conducted using the dataframe <strong><em><code>USAGE</code></em></strong>. Some of the provided labels are cumbersome to work with in R. It is doable, but we can make our lives easier by renaming them. The first task at hand is to rename the column <code>UZA Name</code> to <code>metro_area</code>. The following code will show how that is done.</p>

<p>Each transportation <code>Mode</code> is represented by a two letter code, for example <em>HR = Heavy Rail</em>. The two letter codes arenâ€™t meaningful to us, as itâ€™s impossible to guess what they are. The first thing I did to clean this portion up was to find all the codes used by the <em>Federal Transit Administration</em>. Running the following will give us the list of codes found in the data set.</p>

<p>Now that the data has been cleaned up to a new extent, letâ€™s create a new summary table from <strong><em><code>USAGE</code></em></strong>. To make the outputted table as clean as possible, Iâ€™ve opted to get rid of irrelevant columns and change the acronyms to display meaningful words. <code>UPT</code> stands for unlinked passenger trips and <code>VRM</code> stands for vehicle revenue miles.</p>

<li><p>To find how many trips were taken on the NYC Subway in May 2024, there were multiple criteria to consider here. A filter needs to be used in order to address the transit Mode, month, and Agency. In this case, I made the assumption that the NYC Subway is only operated by the <em>MTA New York City Transit</em>. In May 2024, there were a total of 180,000,000 (1.80e8) trips taken.</p>

<p>After going through this question at hand, I was able to identify that the <code>month</code> is stored as just the first of the month each year. I confirmed that there is only one entry per month for each respective agency, metro area, and mode. Moving forward with any month filters, I donâ€™t have to worry about including the full month as it will always only be in the format of the first of the month in each year. This understanding will be seen in later examples.</p>

<li><p>To find the ridership difference between April 2019 and April 2020, I need to find the amount of trips taken in each month-year and subtract from one another. Again, I made the assumption that the NYC Subway is only operated by the <em>MTA New York City Transit</em>. In the following code, you can see the difference when filtering the <code>month</code> as referenced in the call-out above! The ridership fell by 211,969,660 trips between April 2019 and April 2020. I interpreted this metric as the difference of trips between each respective month-year, not the total difference in between.</p>

<p>This concludes the first half of the analysis. A variety of transit metric data was unearthed. A better understanding of the R functions were explored through data analysis. Now that preliminary data has been identified, we can move forward to the next half of the analysis. The fare data available to use is from 2022. In order to do a deeper analysis, the <code>USAGE</code> table will need to be converted to a 2022 version in order to join the fare data information together. Once we have a combined table, we can uncover what farebox recovery looked like in 2022.</p>
</section>
<section id="farebox-recovery" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="farebox-recovery">Farebox Recovery</h4>
<p>The first task at hand is to extract only the 2022 information from USAGE. The parameters of interest kept are <code>NTD ID</code>, <code>Agency</code>, <code>metro_area</code>, <code>Mode</code>, <code>UPT</code>, <code>VRM</code>. Normally, <code>filtering</code> just the year and <code>selecting</code> the parameters would be straightforward. However, the <code>UPT</code> and <code>VRM</code> need to be aggregated for the new joined table. Additionally, the <code>mutate</code> function is used to convert <code>NTD ID</code> to a <code>double</code> type in order to match the same type as the <code>NT ID</code> in the <strong><em><code>FINANCIALS</code></em></strong> table we will be joining to later. The new table is called <strong><em><code>USAGE_2022_ANNUAL</code></em></strong>. For the farebox recovery analysis, the sample will focus solely on major transit systems, which is defined as those with 400,000 UPT per annum.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>This analysis was ultimately inspired by how farebox recovery rates vary by transit system across the nation. The definition of efficiency I would like to use is the transit system with the highest farebox recovery rate. From this sample, the County of Miami-Dade vanpool transit system is the most efficient. The fares made on the transit system trips exceed the operation cost per trip. Not only does the return cover the operation costs, it also exceeds it slightly. If profit is not the goal for the transit system, the surplus revenue can be reinvested into infrastructure to ensure smooth operations. Continuously enhancing the rider experience can help sustain the system over the long term, with the aim of increasing ride share participation over time.</p>
<p>There are other data points that can be analyzed and incorporated into this analysis for further exploration. Some areas of interest I would explore are comparing trips taken to the total population the area serves. This can give a better idea about what percentage of the population is utilizing the public transportation system. Trends about public transportation usage based on the population available can highlight how popular public transit is depending on an area. Another area of interest I would like to explore is the carbon emission reduction provided by transit systems. A transit systemâ€™s financial stability could be easily offset by environmental impact depending on the mode of transportation. There are multitudes of other data points that can be extrapolated to explore how efficient a transit system is within the scope of defining what efficiency is.</p>
