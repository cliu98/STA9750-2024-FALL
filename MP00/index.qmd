### **Chris Liu**

I am currently attending Baruch College in the Zicklin School of Business. I am pursuing a MS in Statistics with a focus in data science. I hope to pursue a career within statistical machine learning after graduation.

I graduated with a B.S. in Mechanical Engineering from Boston University in 2021.
Some of my previous work done in my undergraduate courses can be found in my [mechanical engineering project portfolio.](https://lhxian.wixsite.com/mysite/me360-product-design-spring-2020)
